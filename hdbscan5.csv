25,scheme launched to help ex-offenders in scotland get better employment support,scheme launched to help ex-offenders in scotland get better employment support prisoners close to release at 2 prisons in scotland are set to receive enhanced employment support in a bid to reduce re-offending rates in scotland. speaking on a visit to hm prison cornton vale scotland’s only all female prison work and pensions secretary amber rudd said: the transition from life in prison to life back in work should be as seamless as possible. getting ex offenders back into work benefits the person the economy and our wider society. and the earlier we get people speaking to jobcentre staff and supporting themselves back into work the better. many people leaving prison don’t have a job lined up or a strong support system around them and this can push them to reoffend. the uk government is determined to deliver for scotland and this commitment to scottish ex offenders does just that. amber rudd also announced that working with the scottish prison service the department for work and pensions ( dwp ) will investigate how to best verify prisoner’s identity and sign them up to start a new claim for universal credit so they are able to access finance once they leave prison. currently prisoners are unable to start a universal credit claim until they are released and this can lead to delays in receiving support if they do not have proper identification documents or are unable to get to the jobcentre to verify their identity. through the pilot dedicated work coaches based in hmp cornton vale and hmp perth will help prisoners fill in their benefit claims through restricted and supervised access to computers and set them up with a jobcentre interview on the day they are released where they will be able to arrange a payment. work coaches will also help prisoners tackle other barriers to employment supporting them to obtain ids prepare cvs and identify training work experience and other employment support. dwp and scottish prison service are also exploring the use of prison documentation to verify people’s identities which is often a factor in the delay in receiving a universal credit payment. many prisoners face difficulties on release and some of the biggest drivers of reoffending are failure to find work and stable housing. latest statistics show that in scotland one in 4 ex offenders were reconvicted within 12 months of being released. more than 186 000 people in scotland are receiving universal credit which includes tailored employment support. it is helping record numbers of people into work with on average 1 000 more people in the uk going into work every day since 2010. since 2010 the employment rate in scotland has risen by 6.2 percentage points to 75.9%. contact press office media enquiries for this press release – 0203 267 5144 press office caxton house tothill street london sw1h 9na london press office (national media and london area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims) 020 3267 5144 out of hours (journalists only) 07623 928 975 england and wales (local media enquiries) 029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099 scotland (local media enquiries) 0131 310 1122 follow dwp on: twitter – www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice facebook – www.facebook.com/dwp linkedin – www.linkedin.com/company/dwp youtube – www.youtube.com/dwp,-1,-2

51,number of children in long-term workless households at lowest level in over a decade,number of children in long-term workless households at lowest level in over a decade the number of children in the uk living in long-term workless households is down 580 000 since 2010 falling to its lowest level in more than a decade. the independent figures from the office for national statistics today revealed that the number has been falling year on year since 2010 down 74 000 on the last year alone. this is welcome news for the next generation with evidence showing that growing up in a home with parents in work is linked to better performance in school and the increased likelihood of being in work as an adult. around 9 in 10 children now live in a home with at least one working adult with 3.3 million more people in work than in 2010. latest figures also show that the number of children living in lone parent long term workless households has fallen 70 000 on the year. the fall in numbers comes as the government’s welfare reforms are making sure it pays to be in work with flexible payments designed to ensure that claimants are always better off in work. work and pensions secretary esther mcvey said: helping people into work and supporting parents and children is at the heart of what this department does. over the last 8 years we have achieved something quite extraordinary transforming this country’s employment opportunities and with it children’s futures. and today we should celebrate that the number of children living in long term workless households is at its lowest level for over a decade. and with the latest budget announcements for universal credit we intend to help even more families as we increase the amount people can earn by £1 000 before their benefit payment begins to be reduced – making sure it pays to work and helping people come off benefits. the figures come while the uk has the lowest rate of unemployment since the 1970s and in more good news for homes across the country wages are outpacing inflation for the seventh month in a row. more information children who grow up in workless families are almost twice as likely as children in working families to not reach the expected attainment level at all stages of their education – analysis has shown that three quarters of children in workless families fail to reach 5 full gcses at grade c or above including english and maths. compared to children from working families those from workless families are also more likely to be workless in adult life. the improving lives: helping workless families policy paper includes research on the impact of children being in a workless family. contact press office press office caxton house tothill street london sw1h 9na london press office (national media and london area enquiries only – not questions about personal claims) 020 3267 5144 out of hours (journalists only) 07623 928 975 england and wales (local media enquiries) 029 20 586 then 097 or 098 or 099 scotland (local media enquiries) 0131 310 1122 follow dwp on: twitter – www.twitter.com/dwppressoffice facebook – www.facebook.com/dwp linkedin – www.linkedin.com/company/dwp youtube – www.youtube.com/dwp,2,-1

68,statement on the changes announced to universal credit in the budget last week and on the managed migration regulations,statement on the changes announced to universal credit in the budget last week and on the managed migration regulations the secretary of state for work and pensions has made a statement to the house today. mr speaker i’d like to make a statement on the changes announced to universal credit in the budget last week and on the managed migration regulations which we are laying in the house today. the chancellor announced a substantial package at the budget to ensure that millions keep more of what they earn and vulnerable claimants are supported when they move to universal credit. in total mr speaker this package will be worth an extra £4.5 billion across the next 5 years. i want to pay a special thank you to all the colleagues charities third sector organisations jobcentre plus staff and claimants who fed back to me to build this package of support to ensure universal credit is a fair system – supporting thousands who can’t work as well as thousands who can. and i’d like to also thank my right honourable friend the prime minister and my right honourable friend the chancellor for their support to deliver these measures. because make no mistake mr speaker: this is a department that listens. and a department that will continue to listen adapt change and deliver. we will put an extra £1.7 billion a year into work allowances increasing the amount that hardworking families can earn by £1 000 before universal credit is tapered away – providing extra support for 2.4million working families. which is why it was welcomed not only in this house but amongst charities. like the child poverty action group which said: “the work allowance increase is unequivocally good news for families receiving universal credit”. and the joseph rowntree foundation which said this extra investment “will help make universal credit a tool for tackling poverty”. and we have gone further – recognising the genuine concerns raised about the support we were offering people especially to the most vulnerable when they move to universal credit. so we have made a further £1billion package of changes providing 2 additional weeks of dwp legacy benefits for those moved onto universal credit – a one off non repayable sum that will provide claimants with extra money during the period before they receive their first universal credit payment. and this is on top of the 2 additional weeks of housing benefit announced at autumn budget 2017 and put into place this year. and we will support the self employed moving to universal credit. we will open up a 12 month grace period before the minimum income floor is applied supporting 130 000 self employed claimants. because we are the party of business we are the party of aspiration. we will support those in debt by reducing the normal maximum rate at which debts are deducted from universal credit awards from 40% to 30% of standard allowances. this will help over 600 000 families to manage their debts at any one point when roll out is complete – providing them with on average £295 extra a year as their debts are repaid over a longer period. mr speaker this is targeted support to help work pay and support the vulnerable. which is why today i lay regulations to deliver the next phase of universal credit – managed migration. through which people will be moved onto universal credit. a move from a system that trapped people on benefits and creating cliff edges at 16 24 and 30 hours with punitive effective tax rates of over 90 per cent for some. between 1997 and 2010 benefit spend went up by 65%. in 1997 households were paying £5 500 in taxes to fund the benefits system – and by 2010 it had risen to £8 350. [political content] under this government 3.4 million more people are in work – the vast majority of which are full time and permanent roles. which means that we have created more new jobs in the uk since 2010 than france spain ireland netherlands austria and norway combined. alongside creating a welfare system that supports those who need it. through universal credit around 1 million disabled households will receive around an extra £100 on average per month through more generous support. the managed migration regulations will in addition: protect 500 000 people’s severe disability premium at the point of migration deliver transitional protection for those we move to ensure that at the point of moving those manage migrated have their entitlements protected we will take a measured approach to delivering managed migration taking our time to get it right and working with claimants to co design it. we have and will continue to take on board the advice of experts and charities. such as the social security advisory committee ( ssac ) – whose report on the regulations we have published along with our response today . and we have accepted in full or part all but one of their recommendations. and the one we didn’t is because we want to be more generous! i pay tribute to the hard work of ssac in scrutinising our regulations. and we have changed a key part of the regulations which charities have raised with me my department and mps. which relates to the minimum statutory notice period for people moving from their legacy award to universal credit. we have extended this period from a minimum of 1 month to a minimum of 3 months – to allow claimants maximum time to prepare and make their claim before their legacy award expires. alongside this we have unlimited flexibility to extend claim periods for people who need it. we will also backdate any claimant who has missed the deadline date but has made a claim within a month of the deadline day passing. and we will test a variety of communications methods including advertising campaigns face to face communication letters texts telephone calls and home visits. mr speaker this will provide support for claimants during managed migration. and we will constantly review our approaches engage fully with charities experts claimants and all members of this house. mr speaker i commend this statement to the house.,10,-1

79,universal credit managed migration: reducing the risk to claimants,universal credit managed migration: reducing the risk to claimants the social security advisory committee (ssac)'s independent report on universal credit managed migration has been published. the secretary of state for work and pensions (the rt hon esther mcvey mp) today presented to parliament ssac ’s independent advice to reduce risk for millions of claimants on ‘legacy’ benefits when they are due to be moved onto universal credit. the government’s response also published today accepted most of the committee’s recommendations. the original proposal required millions of claimants on ‘legacy’ benefits to make a claim to universal credit presenting a huge operational challenge for the department for work and pensions ( dwp ) and leaving claimants at risk of financial hardship as they move from fortnightly to monthly payments. professor sir ian diamond committee chair said: we are delighted that both the chancellor of the exchequer and the secretary of state for work and pensions have listened to the advice of this committee – and to the views of the 455 stakeholders who submitted evidence to our consultation – and taken steps to reduce risk for millions of people. when we put our advice to government on their proposals for migrating existing claimants to universal credit we welcomed the fact that they ensured the vast majority of claimants would not lose out financially at the point of migration. but in several other respects we were concerned that too much risk was being loaded on to individuals. our advice made clear that needed to be addressed especially for those out of work claimants whose circumstances have not changed and who will be forced to move from fortnightly to monthly payments. it was clear that there were steps that the government could and should have been taking in preparing for managed migration that would reduce the risk to claimants. we are pleased that the government has largely accepted our advice – in particular by introducing a 2 week run of payments to out of work claimants to bridge the gap before universal credit is paid by taking more time over the testing phase by ensuring those whose claim is late or who make a mistake in their initial claim don’t lose protections and by agreeing to publish operational readiness tests which have to be met before the main migration begins. nonetheless a lot of detail still has to be worked out. we are disappointed that the dwp continue to expect that everyone must make a claim to universal credit in order to be migrated to it. and we remain concerned about the degree to which the department will in practice demonstrate the openness and flexibility to which they have committed. we look forward to working with them on more detailed plans. liz sayce the committee’s vice chair added: the sheer scale of the operational challenge facing dwp cannot be underestimated. millions of individuals are relying on the government to get this right. the department estimates that at least one third of this group will be disabled people currently dependent on employment and support allowance. many with for instance serious health conditions or learning difficulties will struggle to complete a claim online. we welcome the government’s commitment to ensure that disabled people are supported through the claims process including taking claims during home visits and over the telephone and we are keen to work with the department on the detail of these plans to ensure they work well for all disabled people. when the committee looked at the government’s proposals it recognised that the challenge facing dwp is exceptionally difficult. it is a huge logistical task to contact millions of people who may be receiving up to 4 different benefits administered by 3 different organisations collect any additional information needed to determine entitlement and seamlessly terminate legacy benefit awards (with different rules and definitions) as universal credit awards start without leaving any gaps or overlaps in entitlement. many of the committee’s concerns focussed on the claims process itself and on the move to monthly payments. it is of the firm view that the migration plans should as far as is possible minimise the risk to claimants. the proposals presented to the committee in june did not do that. in fact in some respects the department had chosen to reduce its own risk by transferring it to claimants – most obviously through the proposal to require all existing claimants to make a fresh claim for universal credit. while in some circumstances that approach may be unavoidable but in many it should be possible to make migration less burdensome and less risky for claimants. in examining each of the proposals the committee considered the following questions: is it deliverable – is it likely to work or would it be too complex or unwieldy? is it explicable – will those affected understand it and what they must do? is it proportionate to the problem it is trying to solve? is it fair – for example does it impose disproportionate burdens on particular groups of people? the committee’s 12 recommendations focussed on those aspects of the proposals that did not meet the above criteria. in particular it called on the government to undertake a rigorous and transparent assessment of its operational readiness – including the potential impact on different groups of claimants – and to engage delivery partners and claimants in developing its detailed delivery plans and communications. its recommendations also made clear that the responsibility for ensuring that claimants are moved safely onto universal credit rests with the government. the committee therefore welcomes the chancellor of the exchequer’s 2018 budget statement on 29 october which made clear the government’s intention that the migration to universal credit should be as smooth as possible. in particular it welcomes the chancellor’s announcement that out of work claimants who are currently reliant on fortnightly benefits will receive a 2 week run on of benefit. the committee also welcomes the secretary of state’s positive response to the majority of our recommendations and looks forward to continuing to work with her in ensuring that these proposals are delivered safely and without putting vulnerable customers at risk. the committee also thanks the many individuals and organisations who responded to its request for advice. this informed and enriched its own understanding of the likely effects of dwp ’s proposals. the committee is indebted to them for their help. read the committee’s report on the universal credit managed migration proposals . more information at the point at which the draft proposals were presented to the committee in june the department estimated that over a 4 year period from 2019 to 2023 2.09 million households (2.87 million individuals) will have been migrated. it was also estimated that the majority of claimants being migrated are currently in receipt of tax credits (54%) and employment and support allowance (36%). ssac is an independent advisory body of the department for work and pensions. the committee’s role is to give advice on social security issues; scrutinise and report on social security regulations (including tax credits) and to consider and advise on any matters referred to it by the secretary of state for work and pensions or the department for communities in northern ireland. the committee membership comprises: sir ian diamond (chair) bruce calderwood david chrimes carl emmerson chris goulden philip jones jim mccormick grainne mckeever dominic morris seyi obakin judith paterson charlotte pickles liz sayce and victoria todd. further enquiries should be directed to denise whitehead committee secretary on 020 7829 3354.,10,-1
38,universal credit consent and disclosure of information,universal credit consent and disclosure of information how universal credit claimants can give consent for their information to be shared with another person or organisation to help them deal with their claim. this guide also includes information about how someone can act as an appointee for a universal credit claimant or obtain a lasting power of attorney. consent and representatives you can ask another person or organisation to deal with your claim if you feel unable to: find the information you need understand things about your claim you can do this at any point during your claim. you must give your permission to allow another person or organisation to: act for you have access to relevant information about you this permission is called explicit consent. we call someone who deals with information on your behalf a ‘representative’. a representative is different to an appointee – it is not a legally based appointment. a representative can be any person or organisation acting on your behalf or making enquiries for you. you must provide explicit consent before information can be disclosed to a representative. explicit consent can be provided by you in writing on the telephone or face to face. you can do this at any time during your universal credit claim. you must: give consent for your personal information to be shared with the representative outline what information you want to be disclosed explain why the information is needed explain the representative’s relationship to you where the representative is your family member or friend give the name of the representative and the organisation including the branch where applicable. if you cannot provide the name of the representative you need to be as specific as possible for example you should provide the representative’s job role or team name within the organisation explicit consent does not last forever it usually lasts until either the specific request is completed or the end of the assessment period after the one in which the consent was given. an assessment period is the monthly period in which your universal credit is calculated and paid. you can withdraw the consent for a representative at any time: by making an entry on your online journal in person at an appointment in the jobcentre once you have given explicit consent the representative will need to confirm the following details to receive relevant information about you and your universal credit claim: your full name your address or date of birth what information you have agreed to share the purpose for the information being shared their name or the organisation they belong to (where this applies) if there is any doubt as to the identity of the representative making the request no information will be disclosed. information that will never be disclosed by dwp the following information will never be given to a representative even if you have given explicit consent: your address your date of birth your national insurance number your bank details (sort code account number account holder name) your telephone numbers names of your household members names of your employers or former employers disclosure of information to social landlords social landlords are providers of social housing. these are usually councils or ‘not for profit’ housing associations. if you’re unable to manage your money or have fallen into rent arrears you can arrange for your housing costs to be paid directly to your landlord. in universal credit this is called an ‘alternative payment arrangement’. the following information can be shared with social landlords without needing to give explicit consent: the claimant’s alternative payment arrangement information any relevant criminal history that you may have for example anti social behaviour or other behaviour adversely affecting the local area social landlords will not be entitled to receive any personal data about you. all requests for information will be considered under the data protection act. social landlords may receive the following information: the start date of your housing payments being paid to the landlord when the landlord can expect to receive the first payment the amount of the next payment of the universal credit housing payment towards your rent if there have been any changes to the amount of housing costs to be paid (the reason for the changes will not be provided or discussed) disclosure of information to private landlords private landlords are landlords who usually own the property they are renting out. private landlords can be: a company that owns a lot of properties a person or family that owns one or more properties private landlords can ask for their tenant’s universal credit housing costs to be paid directly to them without the need for explicit consent. you will be informed that the private landlord has requested that the universal credit housing costs be paid directly to them. if you are happy for your universal credit housing costs to be paid directly to the landlord you do not need to reply to give your consent. the universal credit housing costs will then automatically be paid to the landlord each month. if you do not want the rent to be paid directly to the landlord you can dispute this. you will need to provide evidence that you are not in rent arrears in order to dispute the alternative payment arrangement. once the direct payment to the private landlord (the alternative payment arrangement) has been set up the following information can be disclosed to the landlord: the start date of your housing payments being paid to the landlord when the landlord can expect to receive the first payment the amount of the next payment of your universal credit housing costs if there have been any changes to the universal credit housing costs (the reason for the changes will not be provided or discussed) a private landlord can act as a representative for a claimant but will always need your explicit consent to do so unless it is for the specific purpose of requesting an alternative payment arrangement. when dwp can share your information without consent there are circumstances when dwp can share your information without explicit consent. these are: court orders legal gateways mps engaging with universal credit on their constituent’s behalf public interest court orders if a court order is in place dwp does not need to get your consent to disclose the information requested. legal gateways there is law which allows your personal information to be shared with an organisation if they are acting in a welfare capacity. for example dwp can share a claimant’s information with a local authority (and its welfare rights representative) if they are helping the claimant with personal budgeting support and universal support. mps engaging with universal credit on their constituent’s behalf any correspondence (letter email or phone enquiries) relating to universal credit will be answered directly to the mp without the need for your consent. however it is common practice for mps to include explicit consent from you when contacting the department in writing. public interest where it is in the best interests of the public disclosure can be made without your consent. for example claimants with complex needs. these requests for disclosure will usually come from the police or social services. appointees another person or organisation can apply for the right to deal with the universal credit claim of someone who can’t manage their own affairs because for example they may be mentally incapable or severely disabled. unlike a representative this is a legally based appointment. an appointee can be: an individual such as a friend or relative – these are known as individual appointees an organisation or representative of an organisation such as a solicitor or local council – these are known as corporate appointees some universal credits claimants may prefer to have corporate appointees instead of an individual appointee. these are usually charities or local authorities. this means that any staff member from that organisation can act on your behalf. an appointee’s responsibilities as an appointee you act for the claimant for all benefit purposes. if you are appointed to make the claim for universal credit you then become legally empowered to act on behalf of the claimant and are responsible for maintaining the claim on their behalf. you will be expected to answer security questions to verify your identity but explicit consent to disclose information is not required (see the consent and representatives section on this page). you must: tell dwp about any changes which may affect how much universal credit the claimant gets spend the universal credit payment (which is paid directly to you) in the claimant’s best interests tell dwp if you no longer need to be the appointee for example if the claimant can now manage their own affairs tell dwp about any changes in your own circumstances which may affect your ability to be the appointee if universal credit is overpaid because for example you didn’t tell us about changes in the claimant’s circumstances you could be held responsible. apply to become a universal credit appointee to speak to someone about becoming an appointee

of attorney ( lpa ) is a legal document that lets you appoint one or more people (known as ‘attorneys’) to help you make decisions or to make decisions on your behalf. this gives you more control over what happens to you if you have an accident or an illness and can’t make your own decisions (perhaps because you ‘lack mental capacity’). you must be aged 18 or over and have mental capacity (the ability to make your own decisions) when you make your lpa . attorneys don’t need to live in the uk or be a british citizen. there are 2 types of lpa : health and welfare property and financial affairs you can choose to make one type or both. there’s a different process in scotland and northern ireland . to make a lasting power of attorney: choose your attorney (you can have more than one) fill in the forms to appoint them as your attorney register your lpa with the office of the public guardian (this can take up to 10 weeks) it costs £82 to register an lpa unless you get a reduction or

a conditionality sanction is where a claimant doesn’t meet their responsibilities that they’ve agreed to in their claimant commitment. there are different levels of sanctions and they’re decided based on what the claimant did and how often. a fraud penalty is where a claimant has committed a benefit fraud and as a deterrent against abuse of the benefit system the dwp has applied a ‘loss of benefit’ penalty. the conditionality sanction or fraud penalty reduces the amount of universal credit standard allowance : the amount of universal credit that does not include extra money for things like children and housing costs) being paid by up to 100% for a single claimant or up to 50% for each member of a couple (a lesser % is applied to those not in the full work conditionality regime). if either a fraud penalty or conditionality sanction is being taken then no other deductions will be made except for last resort deductions. what are last resort deductions? last resort deductions are for arrears of owner occupier service charges or rent and/or arrears of fuel (gas and/or electricity). last resort deductions are taken in order to help prevent claimants being evicted from their home and having their fuel disconnected. what is a third party deduction? some claimants have difficulty managing their money. they may struggle to pay their household bills and can get into arrears. in certain circumstances dwp can deduct money on their behalf from their universal credit and pay it direct to the person or organisation that they owe such as their landlord or utility supplier (this is the company they get their gas electricity or water from) to clear any arrears. third party deductions can be taken without the claimant’s consent and can be for things like: housing costs e.g. rent (for the claimant’s current address) fuel costs e.g. gas and electricity (for the claimant’s current supplier) council tax unpaid fines or compensation orders water and sewerage charges (for the claimant’s current supplier) child maintenance only 3 third party deductions can be taken at any one time. whilst deductions for arrears of utilities are being made deductions for the ongoing cost of those utilities (gas electricity or water) can also be made and paid direct to the supplier if it is in the best interest of the claimant and their family. the claimant will be notified via their universal credit journal when a third party deduction starts. a third party deduction amount is a fixed percentage that cannot be changed. there is one exception: rent arrears taken at a rate above 10% which can be temporarily reduced where a person is experiencing unexpected financial difficulties. claimants can speak to their work coach for further information. what is benefit debt? benefit debt includes social fund loans recoverable hardship payments advances department for work and pensions ( dwp ) administrative and civil penalties tax credits housing benefit and dwp fraud and normal overpayments. more information on benefit overpayments . what is a universal credit advance? advances can be for: new universal credit claims and/or where the claimant transfers from another benefit to universal credit. the most a claimant can get as an advance is the amount of their first estimated universal credit payment. the advance is repayable over 12 assessment periods and can be delayed for up to 3 months if the claimant experiences an unexpected financial crisis. change of circumstances (up to 50% of the estimated increase in the universal credit payment). the advance is repayable over 6 assessment periods and can be delayed for up to three months. budgeting advance which is for help with any unforeseen expenses (e.g. essential household items) or expenses related to maternity getting or keeping a job. the advance is repayable over 12 assessment periods which can be extended by up to a further 6 assessment periods. only one budgeting advance is available at a time. the rate of repayment of advances is up to a maximum of 40% of the claimant’s standard allowance. the repayment stops where the claimant has a fraud penalty or conditionality sanction and starts again when these end; or where not all of the 40% is being deducted (at the end of the fraud payment or conditionality sanction repayment period) in which case the remaining balance of the 40% can be applied for the repayment of an advance or any other deductions. recoverable hardship payments claimants may be able to get a hardship payment if their universal credit payment is being paid at a reduced rate because of a sanction or fraud penalty and they are unable to meet basic essential needs for themselves and their family. important: universal credit hardship payments are recoverable but only when there are no outstanding deductions for a fraud penalty or a sanction however the repayments can be suspended for any assessment period where the claimant has earnings at least equal to the conditionality earnings threshold. if they are part of a joint claim this will be if the claimant and/or their partner have earnings at least equal to the combined couple’s conditionality earnings threshold. the balance can be written off once claimants sustain this level of earnings for a period (or periods totalling) at least 6 assessment periods since the last sanction or fraud penalty reduction applied to their universal credit award. moving from tax credits to universal credit if a tax credits claimant makes a new claim for universal credit their tax credits award will be stopped. the claimant’s move to universal credit could create a tax credits overpayment which they will have to pay back as well as any other tax credits overpayments they may have. dwp will recover any overpaid tax credits when the claimant moves to universal credit. claimants that move to universal credit will get a letter from hmrc called ‘your tax credits overpayments’ tc1131 . this will tell the claimant about any tax credits debt that will be transferred and recovered by dwp from their universal credit award. different debts may be transferred at different times and therefore claimants may receive more than one letter. if they claimed tax credits as a couple their debt will be split equally. if claimants wish to discuss how their share has been calculated they will need to contact hmrc (details are on the tc1131 letter). how much can be taken from universal credit payments? there is an overall maximum percentage rate for all debts and deductions that can be taken from a universal credit payment. the maximum amount that can be deducted is an amount equivalent to 40% of the claimant’s universal credit standard allowance. there are 2 exceptions to this rule last resort deductions (arrears of housing and fuel) and ongoing monthly costs for utilities (gas electricity and water) where there are also arrears being taken for them. overpayments are repaid at a rate of up to 15% of the standard allowance. if one or both of the claimants’ (if they are a couple) earnings are above the level of the work allowance (if the work allowance is applicable) an additional amount of up to 10% more can be deducted. if a claimant has intentionally provided dwp with incorrect information (fraud) overpayments are repaid by deducting up to 40% of the universal credit standard allowance. if the universal credit claim is a joint claim (a couple claiming together) they will receive a single monthly universal credit payment for the household. if either one of the claimants has debts or deductions they will be taken from the single monthly payment. what order will debts be dealt with/paid off? there is a priority order for deductions in universal credit. it will only be applied if the total deductions would otherwise be more than 40% of the claimant’s universal credit standard allowance. however the following deductions are taken before the priority order is applied (in order of precedence): fraud penalties sanctions short term advance (universal credit advance taken out at the time of a new claim or a change of circumstances) first month advance (universal credit advance – taken out at the time of transfer from another benefit) budgeting advance only 1 sanction or 1 fraud penalty can be paid back by a claimant at any one time. however both members of a couple can have a sanction/fraud penalty applied at the same time. if a sanction is in place and a fraud penalty needs to be applied to the claimant’s universal credit the fraud penalty will take priority. the sanction will be applied once the fraud penalty has been paid off. if a fraud penalty or sanction is being applied an advance cannot be recovered at the same time. this is because the fraud penalty/sanction will take priority. the advance will be recovered once the fraud penalty/sanction has been paid off. if a claimant has more than one advance outstanding the priority order (above) for advances will be applied. a full list of deductions and their priority order can be found at annex a note that the universal credit systems are able to stop one deduction and start another during the claim if the new debt is higher up the priority order than other deduction(s) being taken. how much universal credit will be paid? it is not possible to say before of the end of an assessment period how much will be deducted because of the way universal credit is calculated. once the calculation is made at the end of the assessment period the claimant’s universal credit statement will give a breakdown of each deduction. if the claimant has a query about their deductions they should contact universal credit through their journal. note: when totalling all the potential deductions for advances third party deductions and benefit debt if these exceed 40% of the claimant’s standard allowance then they are capped at 40% (except for last resort deductions). if a claimant is in financial hardship if a claimant is experiencing financial hardship they can ask for a financial hardship decision to reduce the amount of benefit debt they are currently repaying. a financial hardship decision can be considered by dwp if the claimant has deductions being taken from their universal credit for a tax credits debt benefit debt social fund loan or rent arrears (if the rent arrears are being taken at a rate greater than 10% of the standard allowance). if dwp makes a decision to reduce the claimant’s deductions the new reduced deduction rate will be applied automatically to their next universal credit assessment period. what happens to debts if the claimant stops getting universal credit? if universal credit is no longer in payment dwp will pursue other recovery methods for example by deduction from other benefits or voluntary payments. where this is not possible then dwp will pursue the recovery by deductions from pay known as a direct earnings attachment or debt collection agencies. advice on money and debt if claimants are struggling financially or need financial help and advice they can contact: their jobcentre plus work coach citizens advice money advice trust the money manager tool from money advice service my money steps national debtline shelter for help with housing and homelessness stepchange turn2us annex a deductions priority order the following deductions are taken before the priority order is applied (in order of precedence): fraud penalties conditionality sanctions short term advance (universal credit advance taken out at the time of a new claim or a change of circumstances) first month advance (universal credit advance – taken out at the time of transfer from another benefit) budgeting advance any remaining deductions are taken in the following order of precedence: owner occupier service charges arrears (where the lender is not part of mortgage interest direct (mid) scheme) rent and/or service charges arrears (at 10% of the standard allowance). fuel arrears: (gas and/or electricity arrears can come above gas arrears if only one can be taken) council tax or community charge arrears fines or compensation orders (at 5% of the standard allowance) water charges arrears child maintenance social fund loans recoverable hardship payments housing benefit and dwp administrative penalties housing benefit tax credit and dwp fraud overpayments housing benefit and dwp civil penalties housing benefit tax credit and dwp normal overpayments integration loan arrears eligible loan arrears rent and / or service charges arrears (maximum deduction rate of up to 20% of the standard allowance) fines or compensation orders (maximum deduction rate) universal credit systems will be able to stop one deduction and start another deduction during the claim if the new debt is higher up the priority order than the recovery being deducted,21,-1

advice to provide universal support from april 2019 the government has announced. the support scheme will help claimants through every step of making a universal credit claim. it will offer people the comprehensive and practical support they need to get their first payment on time and be ready to manage it when it arrives. universal support provides advice and assistance to help claimants manage their universal credit claim with a focus on budgeting advice and digital support. since 2017 universal support has been delivered by individual local authorities funded by grants from dwp . from april 2019 citizens advice (england and wales) and citizens advice scotland will take on the responsibility for delivering a strengthened universal support service a move which will ensure a consistent and streamlined service for claimants across the country. secretary of state for work and pensions esther mcvey said: since becoming secretary of state in january i have listened to the concerns of claimants constituents charities welfare organisations and colleagues and i have made significant changes to the system like extra support for those with mental health conditions more support for vulnerable young people and more support for families who look after other family members’ children. i have always said we will steer a new direction and work with partners to deliver vital services and get universal credit right. the state cannot and should not work in isolation and must reach out to work with independent trusted organisations to get the best support to vulnerable people. this brand new partnership with citizens advice will ensure everyone and in particular the most vulnerable claimants get the best possible support with their claim that is consistently administered throughout the country. citizens advice are an independent and trusted organisation who will support people as we continue the successful rollout of universal credit. gillian guy chief executive of citizens advice said: we offer independent and confidential advice to millions of people every year and have already helped nearly 150 000 people with universal credit. we’ve seen first hand what can happen when people struggle to make a claim and their payments are delayed. we welcome the opportunity to provide even more people with the help they need with universal credit and deliver a consistent service through the citizens advice network across england and wales. delivering this service will give us even greater insight into the universal credit system. we’ll continue to share our evidence with the government to help make sure universal credit works for everyone. derek mitchell ceo of citizens advice scotland said: in person through local cab by phone and online our network offers top quality advice and support to people applying for universal credit in scotland. this announcement brings an opportunity to further enhance the support we provide and we are pleased that the impact universal credit has on potential applicants – and on local cab services in scotland – has been recognised. we expect the numbers of people in need of independent advice on universal credit applications will continue to increase and delivering this service will help us as we do all we can to meet that need. we will continue the work that the citizens advice network in scotland has always done: supporting individuals to resolve the problems they face and advocating nationally to address the root causes of those problems. more information universal credit means monthly payments and housing costs are paid directly to claimants and requires people to be responsible for managing their monthly payments and bills. universal support currently helps with digital support such as using a computer to make or maintain their claim and assistance in budgeting and managing their finances. dwp will enter into the new partnership with citizens advice immediately and they will run their developing service alongside local authorities until 31 march 2019 when they will deliver the full service solely from april 2019. dwp will provide £39 million of funding from april 2019 to citizens advice and citizens advice scotland to provide this service. dwp will fund citizens advice and citizens advice scotland a further £12 million to set up delivery in the run up to april 2019 to ensure a smooth transition to the new delivery model. this funding is from universal support’s £200 million budget which was launched in 2015. last year the citizens advice network in england and wales helped more than 2.6 million people through their face to face phone and online advice services. they are located in over 2 500 locations and have over 29 000 trained volunteers and paid staff.

allowance’. your work allowance is lower if you get help with housing costs. your circumstances monthly work allowance you get help with housing costs £287 you do not get help with housing costs £503 example you have a child and get money for housing costs in your universal credit payment. you’re working and earn £500 during your assessment period . your work allowance is £287. this means you can earn £287 without any money being deducted. for every £1 of the remaining £213 you get 63p is taken from your universal credit payment. so £213 x £0.63 = £134.19. this means you earn £500 and £134.19 is deducted from your universal credit. if your payment stops because your earnings increased as your income increases your payment will reduce until you’re earning enough to no longer claim universal credit. your payment will then be stopped. you’ll be told when this happens. if your earnings decrease after this and you want to restart your universal credit payment you’ll need to make a new

the amount where your payment stops you will not get a universal credit payment. if your earnings fall below the amount where your payment stopped your surplus will decrease. once your surplus has gone you’ll be able to get a universal credit payment again. you’ll need to reclaim universal credit every month until your earnings have reduced enough to get another payment. you can talk to your work coach for more information about surplus earnings. the statement in your online journal will show your work allowance and when the surplus reduces. if you separate from your partner if you’re part of a couple that claims universal credit together any surplus earnings will be divided equally between you if you separate. you’ll then need to re-apply individually with your part of the surplus earnings counting towards your earnings. if you’re a victim of domestic abuse you do not take on any surplus earnings from your partner. talk to your work coach to make sure your partner’s surplus earnings are not divided between you. if you’re self-employed you can carry over a loss (as well as a surplus) to the following month. a loss will be deducted from your next month’s earnings. how

you’re in northern ireland . your first payment it usually takes around 5 weeks to get your first payment. if you need help with your living costs while you wait for your first payment you can apply for an advance . the wait before your first payment is made up of a one month assessment period and up to 7 days for the payment to reach your account. example you make a new universal credit claim on

about how often you want to be paid. you get this after your first payment. if you’re already getting universal credit and have not had a notification you can ask your work coach to be paid twice a month. when you’re paid twice a month your first payment will be for a full month. you’ll get the first half of your second month’s payment a month after this. the second half will be paid 15 days later. this means there will be about a month and a half between your first payment and the full amount for your second month. after this you’ll be paid twice a month. example you get your first payment on 14 december. this payment is for a full month. if you’re paid twice a month you get half of your second payment on 14 january and the other half on 29 january. you get paid on the 14th and 29th of each month after that. if you live with a partner if you both claim universal credit you’ll get one payment each month for your household. if you live in scotland and you’ve chosen to be paid twice monthly you’ll receive 2 payments each month for your household. phone the universal credit helpline if you’re worried about getting access to this money. if you’re employed and get paid more than once a month how often your employer pays you can affect your universal credit. if you’re paid once a month on the same date and nothing changes in your earnings then your universal credit amount should stay the same. if you’re paid weekly every 2 weeks or every 4 weeks you’ll receive more than one set of wages during some assessment periods. this means your earnings might be too high for universal credit. you’ll be told if they are and whether you’ll need to reapply to continue to get universal credit. how often you’re paid by your employer the impact every 4 weeks once a year you’ll

112,universal credit: personal welfare,universal credit: personal welfare a speech delivered by the secretary of state for work and pensions at kennington jobcentre about the future of universal credit. introduction it’s great be here in kennington this morning. i’m particularly pleased to be joined by frontline colleagues and work coaches in the audience today and i’d like to acknowledge the incredible work you do each and every day to ensure our claimants receive the payments and support they need. i’d also like to welcome alok sharma the minister for employment who i’m pleased could join me here today. and i am delighted to be here to speak about universal credit – a vital reform delivering a fair and compassionate welfare system which helps people into work. let’s not forget that universal credit began with near universal support – across party lines and from charities and stakeholders. because everyone agrees with the principles of helping people into work making work pay and providing support in times of need. and i want universal credit to retain that support as we deliver it in practice. this means delivering it in a way that meets the needs of claimants who come from every conceivable background and each with the potential to achieve their ambitions. in welfare there is no one size fits all solution and universal credit offers the opportunity to move away from that. it must treat individuals as individuals – and i will set out the first steps i will take to achieve this today. the principle of uc and why it matters our welfare system is based upon 3 fundamental principles. first: work – those who can should; and those who cannot should be protected from poverty. second – work should always pay. and third the system should be fair. fair for taxpayers who pay for it and fair to those who receive it and fair to future generations – who do not deserve to become trapped in it. as a nation i believe we all want a decent safety net: if you’re facing a difficult moment in life the state should be there to help you. whether that’s becoming unemployed falling ill or facing bereavement – nobody should find themselves alone in desperate circumstances. but it is vital that people are supported by this safety net not trapped beneath it. it is there to help people get through difficult times – it is not meant to be a mode of long term subsistence for those who can work. for the vast majority of people it is ultimately work not benefits which provides the route to a better life. and the welfare system should clear a path for that route not block it. work gives purpose dignity and security. the opportunity to provide for your family progress in earnings and build a fulfilling life. in this respect the old system was broken; it is why we had to reform it. despite what some people suggest the legacy system 6 different benefits administered by 3 government departments – was not a utopia that we should return to. indeed 700 000 claimants on that system are currently failing to claim their full entitlement because they find it so confusing. these people some of the most vulnerable in society are failing to receive on average £285 a month. under the old regime claimants who moved off benefits into full time work lost welfare payments almost immediately which resulted in effective ‘tax rates’ of up to 90% on their income. as an mp i frequently met people who wanted to earn more but were too scared to take on extra hours knowing they’d have so little to gain. in 2010 1.4 million people in this country had been out of work for at least 9 of the previous 10 years. 1.9 million children lived in households where nobody worked making it more likely that tragically they too would live a life on welfare – with little chance of any kind of progression. [political content removed] we have re introduced fairness into the system. we have capped benefits – so that where the adults in a household are able to work they cannot claim more than what many working families earn. we have taken millions of the lowest paid out of income tax altogether. and we’ve introduced the first national living wage giving many a much needed pay rise. but by far the most important and crucial reform is universal credit. let me explain why universal credit is a force for good. it is based on these principles: a social security system that provides a safety net but doesn’t trap people in welfare certainty that every extra hour of work pays more than staying on benefits with these being withdrawn at a consistent taper rate help to enter work – through increased tailored support provided by work coaches at jobcentres like this one accuracy of benefits payments with those made to in work claimants responding in real time each month to income earned. a digital system – where claimants can access information about their payments online at their convenience these principles pumped much needed fresh air into a failing system and failed thinking on welfare. which is why it is vital that we turn these principles into success in practice. we have steadily invested in universal credit adding £4.5 billion in the last budget following the extra £1.5 billion allocated in 2017 – giving claimants more money as they transition to universal credit. and in many areas we are succeeding. more people will enter work as a result of universal credit and work coach support. the provision of universal support – to provide tailored help for people to make and complete their universal credit claim – is a significant new step in creating personalised support for claimants. and it’s very exciting that from april this year citizens advice will be working to deliver this new support across the country. but in other areas we can improve – in particular we must ensure that universal credit always meets the different needs of different claimants. and today i will outline 3: first – the delivery of the next phase of universal credit known as managed migration must be handled carefully so it works for all claimants. second – flexibility in payments especially on rent and frequency should support people financially in a way that works for them. and third – the system must do even more to support women. a standard offer cannot work for everyone. people’s work patterns the pressures they face their families – everyone’s circumstances are unique. i want to make sure universal credit has enough flexibility to adapt to personal circumstances particularly the needs of the most vulnerable. so let me set out in detail the changes that i’m going to make. delivering uc in a way that works for individuals in the first instance i am not going to be rushed into the mass migration of existing claimants onto universal credit. my priority is to ensure that the transition is done well. as we embark on this next stage i want to be absolutely sure that every person switched over to universal credit is getting a personalised service. i will tread cautiously – not rushing but instead proceeding with the utmost care. i want to ensure every individual is thoroughly supported to access universal credit quickly and successfully. we need to reach out to claimants – so the onus should be on us to deliver managed migration in a way that meets everyone’s needs. so i am going to change the current regulations removing the powers government previously planned to migrate all legacy claimants onto the new system. the regulations will continue to uphold our commitment to protecting claimants receiving the severe disability premium. instead i’m only going to seek powers for a pilot: the chance to support 10 000 people through the process. this is an opportunity to learn how we can best facilitate the transition – before returning to parliament with the legislation which we will need for future managed migration. this will begin as planned from july 2019. these next 6 months will be a period of careful preparation working closely with claimants and partners – many of them who are in the room today to design our communications and support systems effectively. we want to ensure the process goes smoothly for claimants so we will provide tailored communications help with applications and even home visits with bespoke support for the most vulnerable claimants. from july we will carefully migrate up to 10 000 claimants monitoring and adjusting our approach as needs be before reporting our findings to parliament. the lessons from the pilot will inform our next steps but there will be no overall delay. universal credit migration will be completed as planned by the end of 2023. however i will consider carefully the results of the pilot and its implications for scaling up migration. it would not be sensible to move immediately from the pilot phase of 10 000 to full scale managed migration. instead we should start small and build up over time as we develop our processes and learn more. this is the approach any big organisation would take when delivering a complex project. i want to be clear: i will only proceed with this process when i know it can deliver the best possible service for everyone who relies on it. alternative payment arrangements but equally i don’t need to wait for the results of the pilot to see there are issues with universal credit’s implementation which can be fixed now. much of the premise of uc and the positive change it offers is based on the fact that it mirrors the world of work. payments are made monthly in arrears and all the money goes straight to claimants. for many people this is an advantage providing financial independence and preparation for monthly bills and salary payments. but for others this approach does not work; managing their money month to month can be challenging even impossible. that can cause difficulties for people who are already vulnerable and i am determined to do more to help those claimants. there is already some flexibility in the system thanks to the changes that we have already made. around 60% of universal credit claimants apply for advances to tide them over the initial wait for their first payment. 20% of claimants with housing costs have their rent paid directly to landlords because a vulnerability or special need has been identified. and for people unable to budget there are provisions to receive payments twice or even four times a month. but currently only 2% of claimants have taken this option. so although these ‘alternative payment arrangements’ exist to provide people with the bespoke payments they need they aren’t yet helping as many claimants as i believe they could. one third of uc claimants in social rented housing have their rent paid directly to their landlord. but in the private sector that number is only 5%. people in the private rented sector already face a far higher risk of losing their tenancy and i know from talking to claimants and landlords that the current system isn’t working for some of them. so we need to make it easier for tenants in the private sector to find and keep a good home by giving landlords greater certainty that their rent will be paid. therefore i have asked the department to build an online system for private landlords so they can request (where necessary) for their tenant’s rent to be paid directly to them. and i will consider what else we can do because i am determined to help keep people in their homes. i am also looking at what more can be done to support those who find monthly payments hard to manage. we need to go back to first principles: reviewing how we identify claimants who might struggle to manage on monthly payments and ensuring work coaches are moving them onto more frequent payments where necessary. i have asked jobcentre plus to test how we can to improve the provision of more frequent payments for new claimants; these pilots will start shortly and once we have evidence of what works we will roll it out further. we must ensure that provision of frequent payments doesn’t slow the system for users who don’t require them – but i believe we can offer this facility more widely so those in genuine need can take it up more readily. women’s economic empowerment indeed some of the most exciting results we’ve seen from universal credit have resulted from personalised and targeted support reaching the right people. this is particularly true for groups who have historically been left out of the labour market. women can never be truly free until they have economic independence. it is fantastic that 1.6 million women have entered employment since 2010 but for some women economic empowerment remains the final frontier. many women still don’t have access to the opportunities and independence that comes from earning their own money. this can be particularly true of communities that hold a more traditional view of gender specific roles. under the old system millions of women could be written off as “dependents” and left without any encouragement or support from the system. under universal credit that won’t happen. for example last week i visited our jobcentre in birmingham yardley – which has piloted a brilliant project focusing specifically on how to support bangladeshi and pakistani women into work. it is early days but projects like these suggest there are ways to free untapped female potential. and in doing so we’ll benefit communities across the country and inspire the next generation to understand the value of financial independence. since taking office i have also listened to a number of concerns – from refuge women’s aid and others – about how the current structure of household payments penalises women. although one payment per household is an established feature of the welfare system (housing benefit for example has always been paid in this way) i recognise the validity of these concerns. this is why i am committed to ensuring that household payments go directly to the main carer – which is usually but not always the woman. for those couples currently claiming uc around 60% of payments already go to the woman’s bank account. however i am looking at what more we can do to enable the main carer to receive the uc payment and we will begin to make those changes later this year. childcare is essential to enable parents to work. although uc ’s provision of funding up to 85% of a claimant’s childcare costs is higher than its predecessor this is paid in arrears only once actual costs are known. so i recognise that this can cause financial difficulty with some claimants struggling to pay upfront or report their costs on time. therefore i’ve instructed jobcentres that if the initial month’s childcare costs prevent a claimant from starting work the flexible support fund should be used to help smooth the transition for this priority group. secondly i’ve decided we should be flexible when parents are unable to report their childcare costs immediately so that these costs will be reimbursed. taken together these improvements will help to drive the take up of childcare as we strive to close the lone parent employment gap and further boost female employment rates. i believe passionately that economic independence liberates women and i will continue to look at what more universal credit can do to support them into work. cancelling the extension of the two child policy there is one additional change i am going to make. i know that many people are concerned about the two child limit in the welfare system. most families make a conscious decision about how many children they have considering in part their income and the additional costs each child will bring. i think it is fair that those on welfare are asked to make the same considered decision as other taxpayers who support themselves solely through work. so i believe it was right to limit the number of children for whom support can be provided through universal credit – funded by the taxpayer. however i believe it is unfair to apply that limit retrospectively. as it stands from february the two child limit will be applied to families applying for uc who had their children before the cap was even announced. that is not right. so i can today announce that i am going to scrap the extension of the two child limit on universal credit for children born before april 2017. all children born before that date will continue to be supported by universal credit. and that will help approximately 15 000 families a year. and it means that by removing any retrospective application the two child policy retains its fundamental fairness. conclusion i am determined to deliver universal credit’s vital principles in practice. a system that supports people into work supports those in need and provides fairness to the taxpayer. so here’s what’s going to change: a more considered approach so we can provide a better service for everyone moving onto universal credit from the old system greater flexibility on payments so the benefit fulfils its promise to adapt to individual needs and circumstances more support for women: moving payments to the main carer and making childcare payments more accessible and every child born before april 2017 will now be supported by universal credit i know there is more to be done to support the most vulnerable and finesse the system – so that universal credit truly works for everyone. the goal is clear: a safety net but also a system that can transform lives through work – not just financially but in life chances health and social wellbeing i am optimistic – because i know the basic principles are sound – which is why i am so excited to have the chance to get this right. a british welfare system should reflect the values of our country. we believe in fairness and compassion. we believe in standing by people when times get tough. we believe in helping each individual reach their full potential. these values are at the heart of the universal credit i am determined to deliver.,9,5
1,universal credit: support for a maximum of 2 children: information for claimants,universal credit: support for a maximum of 2 children: information for claimants information for existing and new universal credit claimants with more than 2 children. important facts: 1 february 2019 you’ll be entitled to an additional amount for any child born before 6 april 2017. universal credit will no longer pay you an additional amount for a third or subsequent child born on or after 6 april 2017 unless special circumstances apply. for example if you’re already claiming universal credit have responsibility for 2 children and you then give birth to a new child you won’t get an additional amount of universal credit for that new child unless special circumstances apply. you’ll still be entitled to additional support in respect of any disabled children even if you aren’t getting an additional child amount of universal credit for the disabled child. you may still be entitled to help with childcare costs for any of your children even if you don’t get the additional child amount of universal credit for all of your children. since 28 november 2018 the policy for when we’ll pay for children in non parental caring arrangements and children who are adopted has changed. if you’re responsible for a child or children through adoption or as part of a non parental caring arrangement then you’ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. this will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. you’ll need to provide documents to support this. when we refer to a ‘child’ in this guidance we mean a person: under 16 years old under 20 years old and in eligible education or training if you’re already getting universal credit if you’re currently getting universal credit or have been getting universal credit within the past 6 months you’ll stay on universal credit or be able to re claim universal credit. this also means that any additional child amounts of universal credit you are (or were) getting will stay the same – as long as your circumstances don’t change. you’ll be entitled to an additional amount of universal credit for any child born before 6 april 2017. you won’t be entitled to an additional amount of universal credit for a third or subsequent child born on or after 6 april 2017 unless special circumstances apply. making a new claim to universal credit universal credit will accept new claims from families regardless of how many children you have. if you’re making a new claim universal credit will pay an additional amount for all children born before 6 april 2017. if you have been getting support for children in universal credit child tax credit income support or jobseeker’s allowance in the last 6 months you will continue to get the child amount for the same number of children as long as you remain responsible for the same children. this protection will also be maintained through family formation changes such as splitting from a partner in a joint claim or coupling to form a new joint claim. exceptions (special circumstances) that applied in a previous award of universal credit child tax credit income support or jobseeker’s allowance will continue to apply in your new universal credit award unless the conditions for that exception are no longer met. if you are entitled to an award of an existing benefit that includes a severe disability premium or have been entitled to an award of an existing benefit within the last month that included a severe disability premium and have continued to meet the severe disability premium eligibility conditions you cannot currently claim universal credit. you should if eligible claim other benefits or remain on your existing benefits until you are told to claim universal credit. use a benefits calculator to check what benefits you could get if you can’t currently claim universal credit once you’re getting universal credit you’ll still be entitled to an amount for any child born before 6 april 2017. for example if your child is living elsewhere at the time of your claim and then returns to your household as long as they were born before 6 april 2017 you should be entitled to a child amount. note: if this happens and you already have a second child who was born after 6 april 2017 the second child will be moved to the position of third child and you’ll not get an additional child amount unless an exception applies (to the child born after 6 april 2017). special circumstances we call these special circumstances “exceptions”. if you’re responsible for a third or subsequent child and they meet the criteria for the multiple births or non consensual conception exceptions listed below you may get the additional child amount of universal credit for that child. you may also be able to get an exception for any children in your household who meet the criteria for the non parental care or adoption exceptions. this will not affect any amounts you may be able to get for any other children in your household. multiple births you can get extra universal credit for your third and subsequent children if they are born as part of a multiple birth apart from one child in that birth. this means the exception applies to the additional children in that birth. for example if you’re already getting additional amounts of universal credit for 2 existing children then you have twins we’ll pay an extra additional child amount of universal credit for one of those twins (meaning that in total you’ll be entitled to an amount for 3 out of your 4 children). where the first child of the multiple birth is either the first or second child in the household we’ll pay a child amount for all the children born as part of the multiple birth. adopted children since 28 november 2018 the policy for when we’ll pay for children who are adopted has changed. if you’re responsible for a child or children through adoption then you’ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. this will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. the exception will usually apply from the date you become responsible for the adopted child. this could be the date of formal adoption or the date of placement depending on when parental responsibility for the child passes to you. you’ll need to provide us with supporting documents for any adopted child or children who live with you. you can’t get an additional amount for an adopted child if they are adopted from abroad or you or your partner were their parent or step parent immediately before you adopted them. children living with family and friends in non parental caring arrangements since 28 november 2018 the policy for when we’ll pay for children in non parental caring arrangements has changed. if you’re responsible for a child or children as part of non parental caring arrangement then you’ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. this will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. you can get an additional amount for any child or children who are living with you as part of either: a formal caring arrangement an informal caring arrangement where it is likely they would otherwise be looked after by a local authority dwp will also pay an additional child amount where a child in your household (under 16) has a child of their own who you’re responsible for. friend or family carers: formal caring if you’re responsible for a child or children as part of a formal caring arrangement then you may be able to receive an additional amount for these children. this will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. you can get an additional amount for any child or children if you care for them under a formal caring arrangement for example: a child arrangements order a guardianship order a special guardianship order you’re appointed as a guardian (in scotland) a kinship care order (in scotland) a permanence order (in scotland) the exception also applies if one of these formal arrangements was in place but ended on the child’s 16th birthday as long as you have continued to be responsible for them since. friend or family carers: informal caring if you’re responsible for a child or children as part of an informal caring arrangement then you may be able to receive an additional amount for these children. this will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. the exception will only apply if it’s likely that the child would otherwise be looked after by a local authority. you’ll need to provide supporting documents from a local authority social worker using the ic1 support for a child who is informally living with you form . this exception will not apply if you or your partner are a parent or a step parent of the child. friend or family carers: under 16s who have a child this exception applies where a child under 16 who you’re responsible for becomes the parent of a child who you’re responsible for. you may get additional universal credit for the new child if they are also within your household. this will not affect the amount you may get for any other children in your household. you’ll continue to get the additional amount until the young parent either: is aged 16 and is able to claim universal credit or leaves your household leaving their child in your care unless another exception applies children likely to have been conceived as a result of a non consensual sexual act (including rape) or at a time when the claimant was subject to ongoing control or coercion by the other biological parent of the child you can get additional universal credit for third or subsequent children in your household who are likely to have been conceived as a result of a sexual act to which you didn’t or couldn’t consent. this relates to a child who either: is likely to have been born as a result of a non consensual conception (including rape) was conceived at or around a time when your relationship with the other biological parent of the child was abusive and you were subject to ongoing control or coercion in order to qualify for this exception (for a third or subsequent child) you must no longer be living with the child’s biological parent and you’ll be asked to confirm this. we recognise that the handling of this exception is extremely sensitive. however it is very important to have this exception in place to support you if you’re in this position. dwp staff will not question you about the incident other than to receive the claim and the supporting information. any information received will be handled in accordance with the rules that dwp already use for holding and using extremely sensitive information. you can find further information in the dwp personal information charter . this exception may apply where there has been a conviction for rape or for controlling or coercive behaviour but there doesn’t need to have been a court case or a conviction. if you don’t already have documents to support this exception you’ll be able to fill in a support for a child conceived without your consent form . you can do this with help from organisations or individuals such as: healthcare professionals for example doctors nurses midwives or health visitors registered social workers specific organisations such as specialist rape charities – find a list of these organisations they’ll need to provide confirmation that your circumstances are consistent with the exception criteria. you’ll not be placed in the position of having to give details about the circumstances of the conception to dwp staff. even where you can’t get this confirmation still return the form so dwp can make a decision. if you’ve been affected by a crime domestic abuse or have found this information

you’re already getting benefits for more than 2 children you’ll continue to get those benefits. you won’t be paid an additional amount for more than 2 children unless the children were born before 6 april 2017 (on or before 6 april for income support) or special circumstances apply. if you’re getting income support with ‘dependents allowance’ for one or more children and another child joins your household you need to tell the department for work and pensions ( dwp ). dwp will tell you if the amount of dependents allowance you get will change. this will depend on the new rules for claiming benefits for more than 2 children and your circumstances. if you currently claim benefits or tax credits and aren’t moving to universal credit until a later date you’ll continue to be paid an additional amount for each child you look after as long as you remain responsible for the same children and your circumstances remain the same. by child (or qualifying young person ) we mean anyone aged under 16 or a young person aged under 20 who enrolled on accepted or started full time non advanced education such as a levels or approved training before they turned 19. if you’ve already claimed universal credit or child tax credit if you claimed universal credit or child tax credit in the previous 6 months but it was stopped for a period of time you’ll get the same support if you re claim as long as you remain responsible for the same children and your circumstances remain the same. note: from 1 february 2019 you can only make a new claim for child tax credit if you are in receipt of a severe disability premium with either is jsa or esa or if not in receipt have received a payment within the last month. this is because if you are getting a severe disability premium you cannot currently claim universal credit even if your circumstances change. you should if eligible keep claiming your existing benefits until you are told to claim universal credit. you will be contacted by the department for work and pensions ( dwp ) and told when you should claim universal credit. this is to make sure you don’t lose out financially when you move to universal credit. you will need to have been entitled to severe disability premium within the month immediately before you move to universal credit. if you become responsible for another child you should report the birth of a child in the usual way for universal credit child tax credit and income support so that we can decide if an additional amount can be paid. in general you’ll be entitled to an additional amount for any child or qualifying young person born before 6 april 2017. if you’ve another child who isn’t living with you when you claim universal credit but then returns to your household you’ll be entitled to a child amount for them as long as they were born before 6 april 2017. note: if this happens and you’re being paid child tax credit/universal credit for a child born after 6 april 2017 then you may not get child tax credit/universal credit for that child unless an exception applies. if you’re responsible for a child or children through adoption or as part of non parental caring arrangement then you’ll be able to receive an additional amount for these children. this will not affect any amounts you may get for any other children in your household. you’ll need to provide documents to support this. if you’re making a new claim universal credit will now accept new claims from families regardless of how many children they have. if you’re making a new claim universal credit will pay an additional amount for all children born before 6 april 2017. if you have been getting support for children in universal credit child tax credit income support or jobseeker’s allowance in the last 6 months you will continue to get the child amount for the same number of children as long as you remain responsible for the same children. this protection will also be maintained through family formation changes such as splitting from a partner in a joint claim or coupling to form a new joint claim. exceptions (special circumstances) that applied in a previous award of universal credit child tax credit income support or jobseeker’s allowance will continue to apply in your new universal credit award unless the conditions for that exception are no longer met. if you are entitled to an award of an existing benefit that includes a severe disability premium or have been entitled to an award of an existing benefit within the last month that included a severe disability premium and have continued to meet the severe disability premium eligibility conditions you cannot currently claim universal credit. you should if eligible claim other benefits or remain on your existing benefits until you are told to claim universal credit. use a benefits calculator to check what benefits you could get if you can’t currently claim universal credit. special circumstances
